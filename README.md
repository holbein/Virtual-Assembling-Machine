# Virtual-Assembling-Machine (VAM)
This is a virtual machine you can program in assembler.
It is easy to use and perfect for beginners!

The commands:
- LOAD x:
  - copies the value in Rx to A 
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- DLOAD i:
  - directly loads the number i in A
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- STORE x:
  - copies the value in A to Rx
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- ADD x:
  - adds the value in Rx to the value of A
  - stores the result in A
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- SUB x:
  - subtracts the value in Rx from the value in A
  - stores the result in A
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- MULT x:
  - multiplies the value in Rx with the value in A
  - stores the result in A
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- DIV x:
  - devides the value in A by the value in Rx
  - stores the result in A
  - increases the value in BZ by 1
- JUMP n:
    - loads the number n in BZ
- JGE n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is bigger or equal zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- JGT n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is greater than zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- JLE n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is less or equal zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- JLT n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is less than zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- JEQ n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is equal zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- JNE n:
    - loads the number n in BZ if the value in A is not equal zero
    - if not: increases the value in BZ by 1
- END:
    - increases the value in BZ by 1
    - terminates the program run
